# Overview

This program is a interactive Theme Park Simulator designed to demostrate my knowledge of the C++ programming language in a fun, realistic way. 

In the simulator, the user is given 100 tickets and can choose to ride rides, buy food, or puchase merchandise, each with unique ticket costs and effects. The program dynamically adjusts ticket prices depending on the day of the week, giving discounts to certain ride types. It tracks player progress, gives restrictions based on actions completed, and maanges resources through conditionals and loops.

The program uses classes to represent rides, food items, and merchandise, each with a display method to display information about each object. It incorporates STL containers such as lists to store objects, and functions to calculate ticket discounts.

My goal was to increase my skills as a Software Engineer by increasing my knowledge of object-oriented programming and adding another programming language to my skillset, showing others of my ability to learn multiple programming languages quickly and efficiently.

# Development Environment

My primary programming tool was Xcode, while source control was done through GitHub Desktop.

The simulator was programmed in C++ with the following libraries: 'iostream', 'format', 'list', and 'chrono'.

# Future Work

- Combine classes into single 'Event' class that handles all values.
- Implement functions to display items to reduce duplicate code.
- Add save/load funtionality to retain user information.
- Add funcationality to give the user more tickets through different actions.
